# HiveSync — System Overview (Spec Bundle v1.6)

This repository implements the HiveSync system as defined by the **HiveSync Full Spec Bundle v1.6**.  
All backend, desktop, mobile, iPad, and plugin behavior must follow the specifications contained in:

- `HiveSync_Master_Spec.md`
- `HiveSync_Architecture_Spec_v1_6.md`
- `HiveSync_UI_Layout_Guidelines.md`
- `design_system.md`
- `HiveSync_Doc_Spec.md`
- `HiveSync_Visual_Flows.md`
- `Project Manifest.md`

This README provides a **production‑safe overview** for developers and for Replit.

## 🚀 What HiveSync Is
HiveSync is a multi‑device, AI‑assisted code documentation, diff, sync, and live‑preview toolchain with:

- Desktop client (Electron)
- Mobile + iPad clients (React Native)
- IDE plugins (starting with VS Code)
- Backend API & WebSocket gateway (FastAPI)
- Live View broadcast mode
- AI‑generated comment/doc metadata (never code)
- Preview builder for mobile UI

All system rules are defined in the spec bundle.

## 🛰 Server Discovery & Migration (v1.4+)
All HiveSync clients use a **3‑layer discovery model**:

### **1. Bootstrap URL (Permanent)**  
Clients fetch configuration from:

```
https://bootstrap.hivesync.net/config.json
```

This file defines:

```
{
  "api_base": "...",
  "ws_base": "...",
  "min_client_version": 3
}
```

It ensures clients can always reconnect even if servers move.

### **2. Migration Manager**
Admin may broadcast:

```
migration.notice
{
  "new_url": "...",
  "switch_after": "...",
  "grace_period_seconds": 3600
}
```

Clients store + auto‑switch to new backend URLs.

### **3. Local Last‑Known‑Good Cache**
If primary fails, clients fall back to:

1. Last known good
2. Fallback URL (from migration)
3. Bootstrap URL

Offline or long‑inactive clients recover automatically.

## 🔐 v1.6 Safety Layer (New)

The Architecture Spec v1.6 introduces production‑grade safety features:

### **Storage & Limits**
- Project size limit: **500MB**
- Per‑file limit: **5MB**

### **AI Provider Fallback**
- Multiple providers allowed
- Automatic fallback if OpenAI fails

### **Preview Builder Isolation**
- Sandboxed container
- No network access
- 60‑second timeout

### **Cold Start / Warming Behavior**
Clients retry gracefully when backend is waking up.

### **Timeout Standards**
- AI calls: 15–30s  
- Preview builds: 60s  
- WS heartbeat: required

### **Security Baseline**
- TLS renewal required  
- Reverse‑proxy WS upgrade checks  
- Consistent env vars across nodes  
- Scope‑strict tokens

### **Database Migration Safety**
Expand → migrate → contract approach required.

### **Backups**
Nightly backups with 7–30 day retention recommended.

## 📂 Repository Structure Overview

Actual structure is generated by Replit following the specs.  
Backend root:

```
backend/
backend/app/
backend/app/routers/
backend/app/services/
backend/app/models/
backend/app/schemas/
backend/app/core/
backend/app/db/
backend/requirements.txt
```

Clients and plugins follow their own scaffold rules defined in the specs.

## 🧪 Development on Replit

When launching this repo on Replit:

1. Upload all spec files.  
2. Paste the **Kickoff Prompt**.  
3. Then paste the **Phased Build Plan**.  
4. Allow Replit to implement the system **strictly from the specs**.  
5. Validate each phase before moving forward.

## 🛡 Legal & Compliance Notes

HiveSync retains only data required for functionality:

- No long‑term storage of AI prompts  
- No storage of full source code beyond revision metadata  
- All data is user‑owned  
- Telemetry (if enabled) is anonymous and optional

## 🧠 Overview

**HiveSync** is a cross‑platform collaboration system that unifies a Desktop Client, Mobile App, and IDE Plugins through a single backend.  
It provides real‑time code streaming, AI‑assisted documentation, variable renaming, lightweight task management, and unified logging.

This repository contains the three core specifications used to design and build HiveSync, along with this README to guide implementation.

## 📘 File Summaries

### 1. `HiveSync_Master_Spec.md`
**Audience:** Developers & Engineers  
**Purpose:** The *technical blueprint* of HiveSync.  
Includes:
- Full backend architecture & subsystem breakdown  
- REST & WebSocket API routes  
- Event schemas & logging standards  
- Offline sync, safety, and performance rules  
- AI comment generation and preview workflow  
- Admin Panel + Prompt Playground configuration  

**Use this file** when implementing HiveSync’s backend, IDE plugins, or mobile/desktop clients.

---

### 2. `HiveSync_Doc_Spec.md`

## ⚙️ Developer Usage (Replit / GitHub)

When building HiveSync on **Replit** or another environment:
1. Start with [`HiveSync_Master_Spec.md`](HiveSync_Master_Spec.md).  
   - Use this to set up backend routes, AI services, and WebSocket events.  
2. Refer to [`HiveSync_Visual_Flows.md`](HiveSync_Visual_Flows.md).  
   - Cross‑check your implementation with the ASCII diagrams.  
3. Finally, use [`HiveSync_Doc_Spec.md`](HiveSync_Doc_Spec.md) for user‑facing documentation or help content.  

Replit’s AI Builder can read `.md` specs directly — start from the Master Spec for best results.

---

## 🧩 Notes

- All three files are versioned together under **v1.0**.  
- Keep future updates synchronized across all specs.  
- The Admin Panel and Prompt Playground are exclusive to the master developer environment.  
- Always validate WebSocket schema events before deployment.
