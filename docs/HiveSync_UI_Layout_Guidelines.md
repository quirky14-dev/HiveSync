### ** Mobile/Web Adaptation Usage Notes**

* **Hive Yellow**: Use for primary buttons and visual emphasis, not for large surfaces.
* **Accent Blue**: Used for interactivity (links, highlights, focus).
* **Slate Gray**: Serves as the base tone in dark mode.
* Maintain **WCAG 4.5:1 contrast ratio** for accessibility.
* Auto-switch between modes via system preference or user toggle.
* Preferences persist across mobile, desktop, and web interfaces.

### Upgrade Modals (Premium Access)

HiveSync’s upgrade and subscription prompts use the standard modal component and color schemes
defined in this document. These modals may appear when a Free-tier user attempts
to access a Pro-restricted action. Upgrade modals follow all existing layout,
spacing, and motion guidelines, including centered placement, backdrop dimming,
and consistent padding. They do not introduce any new UI elements or colors.

***Subscription Upgrade Dialog (Desktop)***

Used when a Free-tier user attempts a Pro-only feature.

**Title:** HiveSync Pro  
**Message:**  
“Subscriptions are managed through the HiveSync mobile app.  
Open the app on your phone to upgrade or start your 14-day free trial.  
Your Pro access will unlock here automatically.”

**Buttons:**
- **Send Notification to My Phone**
- **Show QR Code**
- **Cancel**

This dialog uses standard modal spacing, padding, and backdrop rules.

---

### HiveSync Upgrade Deep Links

Mobile Upgrade Deep Link:
- `hivesync://upgrade`
- Opens the subscription page inside the mobile app.

Web Fallback (Desktop → Mobile):
- `https://hivesync.app/upgrade`

QR Code should always encode the deep link, with automatic fallback detection.

### iPad Layout (React Native)

The iPad app is implemented in React Native (shared codebase with the phone app) but uses iPad-specific layout rules.

#### Persistent Left Sidebar (VS Code-style)

- On iPad in landscape:
  - A left sidebar is always visible by default.
  - The sidebar contains:
    - Project file tree
    - Diff/patch overview
    - Open editors list
    - Search
    - Project-level actions (Settings, Sync, etc.)
- On iPad in portrait:
  - The sidebar exists but may collapse to a slide-in drawer.
  - User can manually pin/unpin the sidebar.

#### Split-View Editor on the Right

- The main content area (to the right of the sidebar) is a split-view editor.
- Supported modes:
  - **Diff mode:**
    - Left pane: “before” or unified view.
    - Right pane: “after” or inline comments / suggestions.
  - **Compare mode:**
    - Left pane: file A
    - Right pane: file B or preview.
  - **Preview mode:**
    - Left pane: code
    - Right pane: rendered preview (if applicable for mobile UI code).

- Each pane scrolls independently, with optional synchronized scrolling for diffs.

#### iPad Toolbar

- iPad has a dedicated toolbar (top of the main content area).
- Toolbar actions include (but are not limited to):
  - Approve all visible blocks
  - Deny all visible blocks
  - Refresh suggestions (re-request worker patches)
  - Toggle comments visibility
  - Toggle diff view mode (unified / side-by-side if supported)
  - Search in file
  - “Send to Phone for Preview” (enabled only for mobile projects)
  - Git actions (commit, discard, etc.), where supported
  - Editor quick actions (indent, format, select scope, etc.)

#### Drag-to-Reorder Comment Blocks

- Suggested comment / patch blocks within a file are displayed as distinct UI cards.
- Each card supports drag-and-drop:
  - Reorder blocks within the same file.
  - The new order is persisted and sent to the backend.
  - The backend uses the updated order when applying or displaying suggestions.

- Visual cues:
  - Drag handle (e.g., ≡ or dotted grip) on each block.
  - Drop targets indicated with highlight lines.

#### Hover Tooltips (Pointer-Aware)

- On iPad, when a pointer device (mouse/trackpad) is detected:
  - Hover tooltips are enabled for:
    - Diff/patch badges
    - Inline error indicators
    - Variable and function references (where symbol info is available)
    - “Send to Phone for Preview” button (explains what it does and when it’s available)
  - Tooltips show short, user-focused text (no internal dev jargon).

- When only touch is available (no pointer):
  - Tooltips are replaced by tap/long-press popovers where appropriate.

#### Editing Capabilities (iPad)

- Full code editor experience, tuned for touch + Apple Pencil:
  - Syntax highlighting
  - Auto-indentation
  - Auto-closing braces/quotes
  - Undo/redo gestures
  - Quick-jump navigation (e.g., function list exposed via sidebar)
  - Optional mini-map on the right edge (scrollable overview of file)

- Intended scope of edits on iPad:
  - Fix typos
  - Adjust constant values (spacing, colors, dimensions, text labels)
  - Make small logic changes
  - Not meant to replace full desktop IDE, but must be safe and reliable for light edits.

### Phone App Role

The phone app is also built in React Native and retains all existing functionality. The only addition is acting as a **preview target** for mobile React Native projects.

#### Preview Receiver Mode

- The phone app can register itself as a preview device for the current user.
  - On launch (or via settings), the app calls the backend to register:
    - user_id
    - device_id
    - platform (iOS / Android)
    - capabilities (e.g., RN version)
- When a preview bundle is available for that user:
  - The backend notifies the phone app via:
    - Push notification, WebSocket, or long-polling (implementation detail).
  - The phone:
    - Downloads the new bundle (or delta).
    - Validates it (project type = mobile app).
    - Enters / updates preview mode automatically.

- The phone app **does not change its core UX or feature set** beyond:
  - Showing a “Preview updating…” animation or toast.
  - Refreshing the preview screen when a new bundle arrives.

> The phone app is not where code review happens; it is where the **live UI/UX** of React Native mobile app projects is previewed.

## **Desktop Client & Plugin Usage Notes**

### **Desktop Client UI**

| Area                   | Color Usage                                                                                                                 | Behavior                                                  |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| System Tray Icon       | **Hive Yellow (#FFC107)** when active or syncing; **Slate Gray (#2E2E2E)** when idle                                        | Pulses slightly during active syncs or uploads            |
| Background / Window    | **Slate Gray (#2E2E2E)** base, with **Light Gray (#F5F5F5)** for panels                                                     | Semi-transparent borderless window when opened from tray  |
| Header / Title Bar     | **Slate Gray (#2E2E2E)** with thin **Accent Blue (#2196F3)** underline                                                      | Houses “Projects”, “Notifications”, “Settings” tabs       |
| Buttons                | **Hive Yellow (#FFC107)** default; hover to **#FFD54F**                                                                     | Used for key actions (Open Project, Sync Now, etc.)       |
| Text                   | **Soft White (#FFFFFF)** primary; **#BDBDBD** for secondary or muted labels                                                 | Uses system font for a lightweight native look            |
| Notifications / Toasts | Background: **Accent Blue (#2196F3)** for info, **Success Green (#43A047)** for success, **Alert Red (#E53935)** for errors | Slide in from bottom-right, auto-dismiss after 5s         |
| Sync Indicator         | **Hive Yellow (#FFC107)** ring animation                                                                                    | Displays project sync status; clickable for details       |
| Dividers / Panels      | **#424242**                                                                                                                 | Subtle shadows separate sections                          |
| Live View Mode         | Background **#2E2E2E**, overlay bar **Accent Blue (#2196F3)**                                                               | Shows "Connected" or "Watching Live..." with viewer count |

**Behavior Notes:**

* Client remains lightweight — **always running in the tray**, accessible with one click.
* Animations should be **smooth and minimal** (fade, slide, pulse — no bounces).
* When idle or disconnected, color palette shifts to **muted Slate and Gray tones** to show inactivity.
* Active connections (live sessions or syncing) temporarily brighten **Accent Blue** elements.
* In-app dialogs (like settings or account linking) use **Soft White backgrounds** for clarity.

### **IDE Plugins (VS Code, Sublime, etc.)**

| Element                                  | Color / Behavior                                                                    | Notes                                                |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Toolbar / Status Icon                    | **Hive Yellow (#FFC107)** icon or hexagonal Hive logo                               | Toggles status dropdown                              |
| Status Indicators                        | **Accent Blue (#2196F3)** when connected, **Alert Red (#E53935)** when disconnected | Hover tooltip shows connection info                  |
| Context Menu Item                        | Standard IDE colors (inherited), **Hive Yellow** icon accent                        | Adds “Send to HiveSync” or “Open in HiveSync” option |
| Pop-up Notifications                     | Uses IDE’s built-in styling — only HiveSync logo tinted in **Accent Blue**          | Keeps integration consistent with each IDE’s UI      |
| Progress Bar (optional, if IDE supports) | **Hive Yellow → Accent Blue** gradient                                              | Indicates upload or sync progress                    |
| Error/Success Toasts                     | IDE native; HiveSync logo flashes **Alert Red** or **Success Green**                | Lightweight, avoids heavy UI overhead                |

**Behavior Notes:**

* **Plugins should never override IDE color themes** — they blend in and use HiveSync colors only for accent highlights.
* When a user clicks an **invite link** for live view, plugin detects client presence:

  * If **Desktop Client is installed**, it takes over and opens the Live View dialog.
  * If **not installed**, plugin handles the connection using IDE’s built-in panel view.
* Plugins display **status + sync icon** only, not full HiveSync UI.
* All notifications respect **IDE’s native dark/light mode** automatically.

## 4. Mobile & Desktop Consistency
- Maintain **consistent typography**:
  - Code: Monospace font (e.g., Fira Code, Source Code Pro)
  - UI: Sans-serif (e.g., Inter, Roboto)
- **Color consistency** across platforms for:
  - Syntax highlighting
  - Notifications
  - Action buttons
- **Animations**:
  - Smooth transitions for swipe gestures
  - Fade-ins for notifications
  - Expand/collapse for function blocks in code editor
- Responsive layout: adjust panels and padding depending on screen size (mobile vs desktop)

---

## 5. Accessibility
- Ensure **contrast ratios** meet WCAG standards
- Support **dark/light mode** toggle
- Scalable fonts
- Screen reader support for:
  - Notifications
  - AI suggestions
  - Variable renaming updates

---

## 6. Notes
- All colors and layouts are **preferred**, final UI can adapt to branding and design changes.
- Mobile and desktop layouts should **share core components** (diff view, comment panel, notifications) for familiarity.



## 7 Block-Level UI Controls

Every comment block or line must display a small action toolbar when rendered for review:

Toolbar Buttons:
- ❌ Remove: Immediately hides the block and marks state as removed.
- 📋 Copy: Copies the block’s text directly to clipboard (no backend event required).
- ↻ Restore: Only visible when a block is removed. Marks state back to pending.

Placement Requirements:

IDE Plugin:
- Use inline decorations, gutter icons, or hover toolbars.
- Buttons must appear adjacent to the comment block within the editor or diff view.

Desktop App:
- Buttons appear on each block inside the review screen.
- Support mouse hover or always-visible mini-icons depending on layout.

Mobile App:
- Buttons appear inside a collapsible or always-visible mini-toolbar on each block.
- Touch-friendly spacing required.

Behavior Rules:
- Removing a block updates backend state immediately.
- Restoring a block likewise updates backend state.
- Copy does not touch backend; it is strictly front-end functionality.
- Block controls must not affect unrelated blocks.
- Approval/denial applies to the entire patch after block-level adjustments.
